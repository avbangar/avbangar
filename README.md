# Hi, I'm Aakash üëã 
#### Pronouns: He/Him

I‚Äôm a Software Engineer @ [AMEX](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-gb/) working on the iOS application üçè

Swift aside I‚Äôve been known to dable in a bit of GoLang and Haskell, I‚Äôm also a massive supporter of Functional and Reactive programming!

I'm a Computer Science (BSc Hons) graduate from [The University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk) üë®‚Äçüéì

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact: when I'm not programming I love to read! My favourtie books right now are:

## üî≠ Current Projects

When not developing at work I like to play around with the following: 

- [Blog](https://github.com/avbangar/blog): a personal blog site used to sharing posts about cool things I‚Äôve found or learned.

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact: when I'm programming this is my favourite [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7h1MwRW3y7I0ju5LTi9sCF?si=f8dfc0d1ba934428) to listen to!
